# Web tool for Labeling

A simple web app that allows you to upload a bag file, extract its contents and save all the images and then show them, ready to build a set of labeled images.

All the contents of the bags files will be saved into database ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)) to keep track of the work done offering the possibility of resuming it in the future.
